Hi, I'm Dylan

I wish to learn new things and improve my skills by sharing them in a pedagogic way.

On this page you will find my projects and some of the tutorials I made on diferent notions and technologies I used to struggle with, so that you won't have to struggle as much as I did !

Enjoy and feel free to comment or suggest any change that might be relevant.
